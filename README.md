# PostScript::Lib [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/tbrowder/PostScript-Lib-Perl6.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/tbrowder/PostScript-Lib-Perl6)

This repository is intended to be a collection of PostScript (PS)
functions and classes to aid in writing PS and Encapsulated PS (EPS) programs.
It includes a rudimentary text-to-pdf conversion program called *txt2pdf* (patterned on the

Collaboration is welcomed, and git access to the project may be given
to interested parties who establish a good pull request record.
